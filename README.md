Submitted by: **Manushri Muruga Kumar**

About this web app: **Ultimate Git Guide is a beginner-friendly listicle app that teaches common Git commands and workflows. Users can browse Git topics, search by guide attributes, and open detail pages powered by data from a Render PostgreSQL database.**

Time spent: **3** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->
- [x] **The web app uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework**

  - [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added unique detail routes for each Git guide
